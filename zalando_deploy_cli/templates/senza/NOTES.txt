Senza definition was converted, but:

* OAuth credentials were not configured
* TOKENINFO_URL was not set automatically
* Horizontal Pod Autoscaling was not configured
* DNS name was not configured (Ingress)
* many TaupageConfig properties such as docker_daemon_access are not supported
* any custom Senza CF resources or components were ignored

Please review and change files as needed:

* pipeline.yaml: AWS account ID, region, cluster ID and application ID
* deployment.yaml: env vars, resources, ..
* apply/ingress.yaml: DNS name
